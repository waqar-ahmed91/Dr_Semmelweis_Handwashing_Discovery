# 🏥 The Semmelweis Study: Fighting Childbed Fever with Data

This project revisits the groundbreaking work of **Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis**, a 19th-century Hungarian physician who used observational data to uncover one of the earliest known examples of evidence-based medicine. His insights dramatically reduced mortality rates in maternity wards and laid the foundation for modern hygiene practices.

## 🧠 Historical Context

In the mid-1800s, before germ theory was widely accepted, many believed disease was caused by "bad air" or supernatural forces. At the **Vienna General Hospital**, Semmelweis observed unusually high mortality rates among women giving birth — particularly from **childbed fever** (puerperal fever).

Through a data-driven approach, Semmelweis discovered a critical difference between two maternity wards: one staffed by physicians and medical students (who also performed autopsies), and the other by midwives. This led him to a revolutionary hypothesis: **physicians were transferring infectious material via their hands**.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This analysis is inspired by Semmelweis's original data and aims to:

- Recreate key visualizations based on ward-level mortality data
- Investigate differences between physician-led and midwife-led maternity wards
- Understand the impact of introducing handwashing protocols
- Explore how early data science and observational reasoning led to lifesaving medical reform

## 📁 Data Source

The original data was published in **1861** in Dr. Semmelweis's book:

> *"The Etiology, Concept, and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever"*

- Scanned German-language edition includes original hospital tables
- An excellent **English translation** is publicly available [here](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/61227)

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `matplotlib.pyplot` and/or `seaborn` – for historical chart replication
- `plotly.express` – for interactive visualizations (if applicable)

## 📈 Analysis Goals

- Compare monthly mortality rates across different wards (1841–1849)
- Highlight the statistical difference before and after handwashing policies were introduced
- Showcase how Semmelweis used data to challenge prevailing medical thought

## 🙏 Legacy

Semmelweis’s legacy reminds us that **asking questions, observing carefully, and using data** — even in the face of skepticism — can change lives. His work predated germ theory but pointed the way toward it. This project honors that legacy through data and story.
